            <h2>What kind of test is being used to diagnose if I have COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency. All of these viral tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples. Two tests allow you to collect your own sample at home  either a nasal swabexternal icon or a saliva sampleexternal icon – but you will still need to send the sample to a lab for processing.
                Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested). Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses. You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.</p>

            <h2>Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, 'CO' stands for 'corona,' 'VI' for 'virus,' and 'D' for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.
                There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.</p>

            <h2>Should I be tested for COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Can I get sick with COVID-19 if it is on food?</h2>
            <p>Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.</p>
        </div>
            <div>
                <h2>What should people at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 do?</h2>
                <p>If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Where can I get tested for COVID-19?</h2>
                    <p>The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested. See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.</p>

                    <h2>What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of
                        disease</h2>
                    <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
                        available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many
                        countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several
                        have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
                        have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
                        situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple precautions: </p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li> Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
                                Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
                                alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. </li>
                            <li> Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                                anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                                Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
                                droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
                                are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
                                COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. </li>
                            <li> Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
                                Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
                                Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
                                nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
                                can make you sick.</li>
                            <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
                                respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                                with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
                                Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory
                                hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as
                                cold, flu and COVID-19. </li>  
                            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
                                difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
                                Follow the directions of your local health authority.
                                Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                                information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
                                allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
                                health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread
                                of viruses and other infections. </li>              
                            <li>• Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local
                                areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
                                traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or
                                have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
                                Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of
                                these areas.</li>    
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?</h2>
                            <p>No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on
                                bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do
                                not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or
                                treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a
                                physician to treat a bacterial infection. </p>
                            <h2>How to put on use take off and dispose of a mask?</h2>
                            <ol><li> Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers,
                                and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.</li>
                                <li> Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based
                                hand rub or soap and water</li>
                                
                                <li> Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes. </li>
                                <li> Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is). </li>
                                <li> Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the
                                coloured side).</li>
                                <li> Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of
                                the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.</li>
                                <li> Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your
                                chin.</li>
                                <li> After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from
                                behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face
                                and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces
                                of the mask.</li>
                                <li> Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.</li>
                               <li> Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the
                                mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash
                                your hands with soap and water. </li>     
                            </ol>
